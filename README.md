Hello Readers...
I'm just starting Web development again, and learning each thing step by step more precisely.
Here is my first project, in this i made the clone of Spotify by using HTML and CSS.
With the help of this i'm able to understand clearly some important topics like, flex, grid, running media-queries,transitions,etc.
This is just the beginning and much more to come.
